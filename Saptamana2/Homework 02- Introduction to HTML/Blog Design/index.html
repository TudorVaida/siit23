			<h2>Rules for Autocomplete</h2>
			<h5 class="fade"><em>Posted on March 19, 2019</em></h5>

			<div>
				<p>
					Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to
					solve, but so so so many UIs get it wrong. I see this frequently
					enough that, rather than complain about them individually, I though
					I’d just write down the set of rules they often break.
				</p>
				<p>
					There may be cases where some of these rules aren’t the best thing to
					do, but there should be a good reason for breaking one of these rules
					(for example, some of these rules don’t apply if a field must be
					filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states).
					Following these rules should always result in at very least a sane
					experience:
				</p>

				<ul class="list" lista_atribute>
					<li lista_ atribute>
						Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option
						exactly, other options must always go below the one matching what
						they typed.
					</li>
					<li lista_ atribute>
						Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type “Fr” I
						want “Fresno” not “San Francisco.”
					</li>
					<li lista_ atribute>
						After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches.
						Starting with substring matches would almost always be the wrong
						thing to do since users start typing words at the beginning not
						somewhere in the middle.
					</li>
					<li lista_ atribute>
						If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to
						subsequence matching. This is only useful in some cases.
					</li>
					<li lista_ atribute>
						If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally
						fall back to approximate matches. This is rarely necessary to
						provide.
					</li>
					<li lista_ atribute>Matches should be sorted alphabetically.</li>
					<li lista_ atribute>
						When one option is the prefix of another, put the shortest one
						first.
					</li>
					<li lista_ atribute>
						The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are
						two options that differ only by case. In that case (pun intended),
						prefer the one that more closely matches the user’s input.
					</li>
					<li lista_ atribute>
						The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term)
						must be a different key than the action to accept the first
						suggestion unless you have to do something first to start using
						autocomplete suggestions (e.g. hit the down arrow). The user should
						never have to take extra steps to not use autocomplete.
					</li>
				</ul>
